### Think OS Chapter 2 reading questions

For each of the reading questions below, write answers in the form of
a clear, concise, complete sentence or two.

1. Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of the ones in the book).  What is abstractly true about the system that is not literally true about the implementation?

An example of virtualization is the fact that when my trash is picked up by the garbage truck, it ends up in a dump somewhere in the world. Abstractly, the beginning and end points of my trash is correct, however there are a lot of intermediate steps between them. For example, my trash is brought to a facility to be sorted and processed before being brought to the dump.

2. What is the difference between a program and a process?

A program is a set of instructions that when executed will perform a task on the computer. A process is an instance of that program that contains the code and its activity. A program is passive while a process is actively running the program.

3. What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction? 

By abstracting the process, the computer isolates each process which prevents confusion in terms of how the processes interact with the hardware.

4. What illusion does the process abstraction create?

It creates the illusion that each process has its chunk of memory that is isolated from all other processes.

5. What is the kernel?

The kernel's job is to run the core capabilities of the computer.

6. What is a daemon?

A daemon is a process that runs in the background and executes operating sytem services.
