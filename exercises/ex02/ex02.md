# Exercise 2
## Pointers


### The address space

1. Compile and run `aspace.c` in this directory.

2. Read the code.  You might want to [read about malloc here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_malloc.htm).

3. Based on the output, draw a sketch of the virtual address space (see page 80 of HFC).  Show the relative locations of the stack, heap, globals, constants, and code.

4. Add a second call to `malloc` and check whether the heap on your system grows up (toward larger addresses). 

It does. The address of p is 0x7fa0d8402740 and the address of the other call to malloc is 0x7fa0d8402840.

5. Add a function that prints the address of a local variable, and check whether the stack grows down.  

6. Choose a random number between 1 and 32, and allocate two chunks with that size.  
How much space is there between them?  Hint: Google knows how to subtract hexadecimal numbers.

My numbers are 23 and 30. There is 2480 in hex of space between them.


### Stack allocated data

1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as expected?

The purpose of the program is to create an array of size 5 with values of 42 and print each of the values out. If it worked as expected, the program would output 5 45s.

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?

I get a warning that the address to a local variable is returned. This means that instead of returning the actual value of a local variable, the location of the local variable is returned. This is a problem because once I exit out of a function, there is no guarantee that the local variable is still in the stack as it might have been erased from the stack, so that address doesn't actually point to the array's value anymore.

3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it helpful to draw a stack diagram.

I get some strange output. Since foo() returns the address to a local variable's value that is then erased once we exit foo, "array" in main points to a random location in the stack. Then bar() is called which also creates an array and asigns increasing numbers to each spot in the array. Finally main attempts to print out each value of array, but again, foo's array's values are now gone, so the program just spits out random output.

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run it again.  What happens now?

We now can see that the arrays in foo and bar are stored at the same address in the stack. So we know that bar definitely overwrites foo's actions in terms of the array's values.

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results, then check the code in to the repo.

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!


### Write some code

Create a file named `adder.c` and write a program that allows the user to enter integers, one per line, until the user hits Control-D, which is the end-of-file (EOF) character.

It should convert the numbers from input strings to integers and store the integers in an array.  The program should produce appropriate error messages if the user enters something that exceeds the length of the input buffer, or can't be converted to an integer.  It should also produce an error message if the user enters more numbers than will fit in the array.

After the user enters Control-D, the program should add up the numbers in the array and print the result.  

Your program should be divided into at least two functions with well designed interfaces.

Optionally, the program should produce an error if the sum exceeds the largest integer that can be represented.

Hint: You will probably want to use two functions we haven't seen yet:

* strlen: [Read about it here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_strlen.htm)

* atoi: [Read about it here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_atoi.htm)

Before you use there functions, you need to `#include <string.h>`.
